# ⚡ Basic Analog Circuit Designs (LTSpice Simulations)

This repository showcases a collection of fundamental analog circuit designs simulated using **LTSpice**. As an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student, proficiency in circuit simulation software is crucial for understanding circuit behavior, validating theoretical concepts, and troubleshooting designs before physical implementation.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of various basic analog circuits. Each simulation aims to illustrate specific circuit characteristics, responses, and design principles. It's a learning resource that highlights:

* **Practical application of theoretical knowledge:** Bridging the gap between classroom concepts and real-world circuit behavior.
* **Proficiency in LTSpice:** Demonstrating the use of a powerful, free circuit simulator.
* **Understanding of analog circuit analysis:** Observing frequency responses, transient behaviors, and steady-state conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **LTSpice:** A high-performance SPICE simulator, schematic capture, and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for easing the design of analog circuits.
* **Analog Circuit Design Principles:** Fundamental concepts of electronics including Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, superposition, Thevenin/Norton equivalents, filter theory, amplifier stages, etc.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by circuit type or concept. Each folder typically contains:

* `.asc` files: LTSpice schematic files.
* `.net` files: LTSpice netlist files (generated by the simulator).
* `.raw` files: Simulation data files (generated after running a simulation).
* `images/` (optional): Screenshots of waveforms or schematics for quick preview.
* `notes.md` (optional): Brief explanations or analysis specific to that circuit.

## ▶️ Getting Started

To explore these simulations:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahrufhossain/circuit_designs.git
    cd circuit_designs/LtSpice_Simulations
    ```
2.  **Install LTSpice:** If you don't have it already, download and install the latest version from the [Analog Devices website](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
3.  **Open a schematic:** Navigate to any circuit folder and open the `.asc` file (e.g., `RC_LowPass.asc`) directly with LTSpice.
4.  **Run Simulation:** Once opened in LTSpice, press the "Run" button (the running man icon) or go to `Simulate > Run` to execute the simulation and view the waveforms.
